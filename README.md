## Reflection
This project helped me better understand how a real React application is built from start to finish. I learned how to structure a project using components, pages, hooks, and context so that the code stays organized and easy to read.

I improved my understanding of React Router by setting up multiple pages, including a home page, country detail page, and a not found page. Using dynamic routes helped me understand how to pass values through the URL and load different data based on user interaction.

Overall, this project increased my confidence in building React applications. It showed me how individual concepts like state, effects, routing, and reusable components come together to create a complete, working application.
